# Changelog

## beta 0.8 — 2026-10-07

Customization and realtime-output beta focused on lower perceived latency and user-controlled live behavior.

- Renamed **Academic & Capture** to **Custom Settings** and reorganized it into language/translation, speech segmentation, realtime, and capture/storage sections.
- Exposed additional persistent settings including speech threshold, pre-roll, translation context segments, academic-term preservation, screenshot monitor, realtime startup delay, ASR partial interval, and translation partial interval.
- All custom values are saved to the portable `data/config.json` and restored automatically on the next launch; existing beta 0.7 configs migrate through the normal model defaults without losing provider profiles.
- Added an **Output mode** selector to the Live workspace with **Sentence mode** as the default and **Realtime · Experimental** as the optional low-latency mode.
- Realtime mode performs incremental provisional ASR while speech is still in progress, then performs throttled provisional translation updates.
- Added latest-snapshot scheduling for realtime ASR so stale partial jobs are dropped instead of building an inference queue.
- Provisional realtime text is rendered in-place in the WebUI and floating window, visually distinguished from finalized text, and is never written to session history or exports.
- Endpoint completion still triggers one final ASR pass and one final translation pass; only those final results are persisted.
- Retained the existing sentence-mode pipeline unchanged for users who prefer maximum stability and lower compute/network usage.
- Updated WebUI, startup labels, tests, example configuration, and release metadata to beta 0.8.

## beta 0.7 — 2026-10-07

Persistent provider-profile beta focused on reliable local/remote configuration switching.

- Added independent ASR profiles for Local Whisper and OpenAI-compatible services such as llama.cpp, vLLM, LM Studio, and LocalAI.
- Added independent translation profiles for Bing Free, Microsoft Translator, and OpenAI-compatible services.
- The WebUI now restores the last saved active ASR and translation providers during startup instead of showing the HTML fallback choices first.
- Switching providers now stores the previous provider's form state and loads the selected provider's own settings without clearing inactive URLs, API keys, endpoints, models, device choices, or regions.
- Removed the beta 0.4–0.6 behavior that erased OpenAI-compatible / llama.cpp fields when Local Whisper or Bing was saved.
- Existing beta 0.6 `data/config.json` files are migrated automatically: the currently configured providers are placed into provider-specific profiles while runtime-compatible `asr` and `translation` mirrors are preserved.
- Added provider-profile migration and persistence tests, including stale legacy-mirror recovery and inactive-profile retention.
- Fixed the beta 0.6 floating-window wrapper name collision and updated the WebUI/floating-window version label to beta 0.7.

## beta 0.6 — 2026-10-04

Apple silicon and cross-platform installation beta.

- Added MLX Whisper inference through Apple MLX / Metal on M-series Macs.
- Added automatic, CPU, and Apple silicon GPU device modes on supported Macs; Windows retains automatic, CPU, and CUDA modes.
- Automatic mode selects MLX on Apple silicon, CUDA when the Windows NVIDIA runtime is available, and CPU as the fallback.
- Installers detect the platform and architecture, install the matching dependencies, prepare the selected model, and run real inference checks before marking setup complete.
- Added project-local MLX model storage on macOS; other model sizes download on first selection to avoid preloading every model.
- Preserved beta 0.5 portable CUDA setup, model installation, and capture reliability fixes.
- Updated Chinese and English installation guides, startup scripts, app version, and release metadata.

## beta 0.5 — 2026-10-04

Whisper/Bing live-path and Windows microphone/configuration reliability beta.

- Prevented settings and live-capture actions from using the WebUI before its configuration has finished loading; concurrent early actions now share the same initialization request.
- Native Windows capture now confirms the WASAPI device opened instead of waiting for the first audio frame, so a quiet input no longer produces a false startup failure; device-open errors are reported immediately.
- Fixed Windows CUDA runtime extraction: the bundled 7z archive uses BCJ2, which `py7zr` does not support, so Windows now extracts it with the built-in `tar.exe`.
- The installer now checks dependency and asset-install exit codes, verifies its completion marker, and stops instead of launching after a failed setup.
- CUDA installation is not marked complete unless the real Whisper CUDA inference self-test succeeds.
- The app registers the project-local CUDA DLL directory itself, so manually launched WebUI processes can use the portable runtime too.
- Bumped the WebUI, API, and install marker to beta 0.5.

## beta 0.4 — 2026-10-04

Local Whisper / Bing reliability and one-click portable installation beta.

- Decoupled live ASR from translation: a recognized source segment is now saved and displayed immediately, then updated in place when translation finishes.
- Translation failures no longer hide or discard successfully recognized Whisper text.
- Added stage-specific live error logging for ASR and translation failures.
- Fixed Bing Free response handling by extracting `translations[0].text` instead of stringifying the complete response object.
- Added Bing-specific language mapping, including `auto-detect`, `zh-Hans`, and `zh-Hant`.
- Local Whisper provider tests now execute a real inference pass instead of checking model construction only, exposing missing CUDA runtime libraries such as `cublas64_12.dll` before a live session.
- Local Whisper can load directly from project-local model folders under `models/faster-whisper/<model>/`.
- Added a Windows one-click installer: `install.bat` / `install.ps1` creates `.venv`, installs dependencies, and prepares all five supported Whisper models (`tiny`, `base`, `small`, `medium`, `large-v3-turbo`).
- On Windows systems with an NVIDIA GPU, the installer also prepares a project-local CUDA 12 cuBLAS/cuDNN runtime under `runtime/cuda12/bin` without changing the system-wide CUDA installation.
- Added real CPU and CUDA Whisper inference self-tests during installation; CUDA failure leaves CPU mode available and reports the failure explicitly.
- Added `start_webui.bat`; the first launch automatically invokes the one-click installer when beta 0.4 assets are not yet prepared.
- Local Whisper and Bing modes now clear stale OpenAI-compatible/llama.cpp fields when settings are saved.
- Portable runtime downloads are excluded from Git through `runtime/`.

## beta 0.3 — 2026-10-04

Windows native-microphone reliability beta.

- Fixed Windows native microphone capture for external / USB microphones that are detected correctly but fail to deliver audio.
- Native microphone enumeration is now restricted to WASAPI endpoints, removing duplicate MME / DirectSound-style entries.
- The native capture backend now negotiates a compatible PCM16 sample-rate/channel combination instead of assuming `defaultSampleRate + maxInputChannels` will open successfully.
- Microphone capture prefers mono for speech recognition while WASAPI loopback continues to prefer stereo.
- The WebUI now waits for a real native audio-level packet before marking Windows microphone startup as successful.
- Added actionable timeout / connection messages when a native microphone opens but no audio stream arrives.
- Added beta 0.3 unit coverage for native capture format preference.
- Retains the beta 0.2 experimental Document Picture-in-Picture floating window.

## beta 0.2 — 2026-10-04

Floating-window beta focused on single-screen academic use.

- Added an **Experimental Floating Window** based on Document Picture-in-Picture for supported desktop Chromium browsers.
- Floating window can remain above Zoom, WebEx, browser classes, slide decks, and other desktop applications.
- Two-column layout keeps original text and translation aligned by segment with one shared scrollbar.
- Floating subtitles auto-follow the newest segment and pause follow mode when the user scrolls upward.
- Added `Back to WebUI` and close controls inside the floating window.
- Added configurable floating-window default width, height, and subtitle font size.
- Manual floating-window resizing automatically persists the new width and height to the portable config.
- Standard WebUI remains unchanged as the main capture, ASR, translation, notes, and session-management workspace.
- Updated Chinese / English documentation for browser support and usage limitations.

## beta 0.1 — 2026-10-04

First public beta.

- Portable-by-default storage: `data/`, `models/`, `cache/`, `logs/`, `.venv/` stay inside the project directory.
- Removed automatic AppData / legacy v0.2 data reuse.
- Local Faster-Whisper models download into `models/faster-whisper/`.
- Hugging Face, pip, and temporary caches are redirected into `cache/`.
- WebUI-only distribution.
- Unified Live workspace for lectures, meetings, interviews, seminars, and conferences.
- Library session deletion.
- Chinese / English interface switching.
- Unified OpenAI Chat Completions mode for remote ASR.
- Mainstream target-language list; Malay remains available as a source language.
- Synchronized scrolling between original and translation panels.
- Automatic follow-to-latest behavior with manual-scroll pause/resume.
- Compact interface-language settings UI.
- GitHub-friendly default providers: Local Faster-Whisper + Bing Free (experimental).
- OpenAI-compatible provider remains the generic integration path for llama.cpp, vLLM, LM Studio, LocalAI, and compatible services.
- Lower endpointing latency and HTTP connection reuse.

Beta builds use `beta x.y` identifiers. Semantic version numbers will begin with the first stable release.
